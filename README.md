# Data-Driven-Insights-An-Exploratory-Analysis
This project analyzes 8,939 animal-related incidents based on cost, location, and type to improve resource allocation and response efficiency. EDA and data cleaning address missing values, correct data irregularities, and standardize timestamps.
#Conclusion

Certain areas and property types are hotspots for animal-related incidents.

Cost efficiency can be improved by focusing on high-frequency, high-cost incident categories.

Better resource allocation based on area-specific trends could enhance response outcomes.
