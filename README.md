# Data-Driven-Insights-An-Exploratory-Analysis
This project analyzes 8,939 animal-related incidents based on cost, location, and type to improve resource allocation and response efficiency. EDA and data cleaning address missing values, correct data irregularities, and standardize timestamps.

Dataset Overview

This dataset contains 8,939 rows and 8 columns, detailing animal-related incidents and their associated costs, locations, and types. Key columns include:

DateTimeOfCall: The date and time of the incident.

HourlyNotionalCost and IncidentNotionalCost: Cost metrics related to each incident.

AnimalGroupParent: The animal group involved in the incident.

PropertyCategory: The type of property affected.

SpecialServiceTypeCategory and SpecialServiceType: Categories and specific details of services provided.

Area: The geographical area of the incident.

There are some missing values in the IncidentNotionalCost and Area columns.

Problem Statement

Analyze the dataset to understand the nature of animal-related incidents, their costs, and geographic distribution to improve resource allocation and response efficiency.

Solution Statement

By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and applying data cleaning, this report will identify patterns and trends in animal-related incidents, propose cost optimization strategies, and suggest improvements in resource deployment.

Data Cleaning Summary

Missing values in the IncidentNotionalCost and Area columns were addressed.

Irregularities in the AnimalGroupParent column (e.g., "Ra^&it") were corrected.

Date and time data were standardized for consistency.

#Conclusion

Certain areas and property types are hotspots for animal-related incidents.

Cost efficiency can be improved by focusing on high-frequency, high-cost incident categories.

Better resource allocation based on area-specific trends could enhance response outcomes.
